Git is a distributed version control system and source code management system.
That allows us to manage code efficiently and helps to create a track of it.

git init- initializes a local git repo .git
git add- add files to staging area
git commit- commit files to commit area

git remote add origin url - to add remote repo

if we done any changes to same file in diffrent branches merge conflits will come

git fetch - it will fetch the file but will not add to the branches in local
git pull -action of fetch and merge 

git stash- it will hide if any file that are in the staging area to stash, this will help if any other commit has to be mad
